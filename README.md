### Computer Science & Cyber Security
In Computer Science and Cybersecurity we learn how coding apps and websites can create safer environments to learn.
Let's get geekie.
Students will download a local website with image and Youtube video links.
Use Chrome locally (going inside the computer, called a pathway).
Then they will change the content to something else they find on the internet using Microsoft Visual Code Studio.
This will be their own content or someone else's.
Students will also learn how website scripting will keep their browsers safe (Javascript autoexecute).


Ideas
- Download Files from 
- Q:\Computer Science\Introduction-Static-HTML-master
- Google Drive: Annual Resources / Open House / Website Activity

- Read index.html to know about diffent layout lines
- Render locally (teacher and student machines)
- Change all white text (Microsoft Visual Code Studio)
  - might be all they do
- Find and Image and change the URL
- Find a Youtube Video and change it

Note:
- Notepad or Notepad++ will work
- Using Chrome to point to Q: will work
- / \ are used differently
- https/80 & https/443 are called sockets (the basics of hacking and cybersecurity)
- Search Javascript in Chrome / Settings to see if Javascript can be turned off
